- If the PR passed the validity and basic quality checks, we assign a reviewer to your PR.
- If the PR didn't meet the validation criteria, we either send it back with request of changes or reject it.

**3. Review the PR**
- For a valid PR the assigned reviewer checks the PR.
- If everything is OK, the reviewer will approve the PR.
- If some changes are needed, the reviewer will request them.
- You can make the requested changes and submit the PR for the review again.

**4. Approved**
- Once the PR is approved, we merge your PR. Good job!

## How to choose an issue
We use GitHub issues to manage development process. If you are not sure where to start, you can try working on one of the ["good first issue"](https://github.com/5sControl/min-max/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) labeled issues. There are also the issues with ["contributions welcome"](https://github.com/5sControl/min-max/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22contributions+welcome%22) label. These issues may be a bit more complicated but we believe that these issues suit well for outside contributions.

If you start working on an issue, leave a comment so that other people know that you're working on it. You can also use the issue comment thread to coordinate if you are working on an issue in a group.

## License
Please make sure you've added a license at the top of new files.
