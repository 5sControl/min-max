- For a valid PR the assigned reviewer checks the PR.
- If everything is OK, the reviewer will approve the PR.

## How to choose an issue
We use GitHub issues to manage development process. If you are not sure where to start, you can try working on one of the "good first issue" labeled issues. There are also the issues with "contributions welcome" label. These issues may be a bit more complicated but we believe that these issues suit well for outside contributors.

If you start working on an issue, leave a comment so that other people know that you're working on it. You can also use the issue comment thread to coordinate if you are working on an issue in a group.

## License
Please make sure you've added a license at the top of new files.
